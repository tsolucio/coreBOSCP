----------------------------------------------------

=> protected/patches
  contains patch files with tests and other functionality examples (like three column detail view patch)

=> protected/config/devel.php and protected/config/devel.template.php
  the main.php config file loads the protected/config/devel.php file to override the configuration
  values with developers dependent values. There is an example of the structure of the file in
  protected/config/devel.template.php

=> Code License
  the license of the code can be found in protected/license.txt, it is both in HTML and php format
  this license should be pasted at the top of any new file that belongs to the project

=> yii
  this directory contains the complete yii framework as it can be downloaded from the project's site
  inside the directory the file VERSION is a text file with the exact version used, the file LICENSE
  is the yii framework license and the files vtyiiCPng.* detail the modifications that have been made
  to the base code framework files in case an upgrade is needed. If no vtyiiCPng.* file exist it is
